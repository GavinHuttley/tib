The notes for this topic are focussed principally on the biological and statistical component of molecular evolutionary analyses. The Python library which we will use for manipulation of genomic data and for molecular evolutionary analyses, ``cogent3``, is presented in :ref:`cogent3_topic`.

      slide with one individual who is a heterozygote, get students to predict possible genotypes of a single progeny
      - probability of single progeny each genotype
      * consider successive generations
      * imagine selection operating on adolescent phenotype, does that impact on genotype of progeny?
      * so deleterious variation could make to birth
      * what if phenotype is environmentally conditioned, die only if temperature > 40C
      * rather elaborate thought experiment is to illustrate that
      	* evolution without selection is possible
      	* that mildly deleterious variants can become fixed
