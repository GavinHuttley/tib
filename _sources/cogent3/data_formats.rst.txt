Oh dear, this is a mess. Not this document, but the "multitude" of data format standards in Bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is replete with different variants on basic formats. Not all standards are well documented and support for them is ... well, I hope your experience is better than mine. The fact that data formats can be such a problem is a great argument for :ref:`knowing how to code <intro_to_python>`, since that skill gives you the ability to handle the different format variants that no existing tool handles.

The above aside, I will briefly describe and link [1]_ to the canonical description of a data format for the main types of data. I've grouped these into formats related to the major biological data types of sequences, genomic features, and phylogenetic trees.

.. [1] If I can find one.

Sequences and alignments
------------------------

``fasta``
^^^^^^^^^
The most commonly, and probably the easiest to parse, format is that of ``fasta``. There are too many variants of this basic format, so I just `link to the Wikipedia entry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format>`_ and then present an example below.::

    >seqlabel 1 line
    ACCGGTGA
    AAG
    >seqlabel2
    AGGCG

While this is listed as a sequence format it's often used to include multiple sequences, which may be aligned.

``genbank``
^^^^^^^^^^^

GenBank_ is a web portal to a multitude of valuable databases and bioinformatic tools. They also define a number of data file formats and, in particular, the ``genbank`` format for sequence data. This is format includes at a minimum extensive meta-data about a database entry. They do not always contain sequence, but will at least reference identifiers of related sequence records in their database. Below is a `sample record <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/AF165912>`_ from GenBank (which  I've edited for brevity)

``gff`` â€“ general feature format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. epigraph::

     The GFF format, although widely used, has fragmented into multiple incompatible dialects.

     --- Lincoln Stein, in the prologue to defining ``gff3``.

Sounds like the cartoon at the top doesn't it! Anyway, it is widespread and an important format for storing information about sequence annotations [2]_, so here's the canonical gff3_ definition. This is a tab delimited format with 9 distinct fields. It's the last field, ``attributes``, that proves to be the most difficult to parse. Below is a small sample of a file posted on the definition page.

.. [2] Annotations associate a reported feature of the sequence and the specific sequence coordinates to which it maps, e.g. the promoter for the gene CCT in the sample GenBank record.
