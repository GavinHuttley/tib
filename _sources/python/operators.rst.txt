Operators
=========

In addition to the mathematical operators we have covered, there are *relational operators*.

- ``<`` less than
- ``<=`` less than or equal to
- ``>`` greater than 
- ``>=`` greater than or equal to
- ``==`` equal to
- ``!=`` not equal to
- ``is`` the same instance, has the same location in memory [1]_.

.. [1] This is more stringent than ``==``.

Exercises
=========

#. Try these operators on different data types, e.g.

    .. jupyter-execute::
        :linenos:

        "abcd" < "ABCD"

#. What happens if you try them on different data types?
