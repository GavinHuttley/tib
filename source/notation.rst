    ``a_variable``, Refers to a variable with name a_variable in a program.
    ``a_function()``, "Really just a different type of variable, but the parentheses indicate it's a function."
    ``python``, "This is a command and has the same style as the above 2, but refers to the python program (not the language). You figure out what is being referred to from the context."
    ``$ command``, Indicates a command executed at a terminal prompt.
    ``<some variable>``, "You know the characters :math:`<` and :math:`>` from mathematical notation where they mean less than and greater than respectively. In this usage, we call them 'angle brackets' and they surround a variable that the user (you) needs to fill in."
    :math:`a`, Denotes a variable in the mathematical sense.

.. note:: All code has been executed using Jupyter. By default when you run a cell within Jupyter, it will display the last variable or unassigned output of a statement without the use of a print statement. This is not a standard function of all IDEs and may lead to differing displays.
