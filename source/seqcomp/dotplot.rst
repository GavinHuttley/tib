Dotplot -- Alignment of sequences related by descent from a common ancestor
===========================================================================

This very neat approach to establishing the relatedness between biological sequences was invented here at ANU, by Dr. Adrian Gibbs.

Below is a subset of Figure 1 of Gibbs and McIntyre. Dotplot of cytochrome C amino acid sequences from Human to: Rhesus macaque, Tuna fish. (The N-terminus is at the top left, which corresponds to the "translation start" the protein.) Each dot indicates where the amino acid is identical between the two sequences.

Long stretches of identity form a diagonal. A break -- existence of multiple diagonals -- can arise from changes in "state" (the amino acids differ, but the flanking amino acids are the same), or insertions / deletions (new sequence inserted or existing sequence removed) that have occurred. The latter are frequently referred to as "indels".

.. note:: When analysing two sequences, it is typically not possible to establish whether it was a deletion or an insertion.
