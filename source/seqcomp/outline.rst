Outline
=======

- We initiate the topic by emphasising the role of sequences as the hereditary information store.
- We then introduce |kmers| as a basic quantity for describing biological sequences.
- Algorithms for counting |kmers| are introduced.
- The relationship between |kmers| and functional motifs is developed along with descriptions of experiments that are used to identify functional motifs.
- We introduce Shannon's entropy for measuring information content of sequences and extend it to identifying binding motifs.
- The odds-ratio is introduced as a statistical method for identifying enrichment relative to background distribution.
- We proceed to algorithms for examining whether sequences descend from a common ancestor.
- The brute force dotplot algorithm for comparing related sequences is contrasted with an elegant dynamic programming algorithm.
