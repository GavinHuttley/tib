Sequence Comparison

For this topic, we frame problems in terms of biological questions and, where relevant, specific biological theory. Quantitative development is focussed on posing research questions statistically and or algorithmically. We will interpret their application on biological data.

There are additional coding skills that you need to develop, but these skills are now targeted at specific properties of biological sequences.
